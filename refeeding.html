        <h1>Phase 3: The Refeeding Plan</h1>
        <p><strong>"The fast fixes the problem, but the food heals the body."</strong> This is the most dangerous part
            of the protocol. If you eat the wrong things too fast, you can cause swelling (edema), stress your kidneys,
            or cancel out the healing benefits of the fast.</p>

        <div class="guiding-questions">
            <h3>How to Start Eating</h3>
            <div class="question-item">
                <span class="question-label">How long was your fast?</span>
                If it was <strong>longer than 3 days</strong> <span class="action-arrow">&rarr;</span> Drink liquids
                only for the first 12 to 24 hours. Go very slowly.
                <br>If it was <strong>shorter than 36 hours</strong> <span class="action-arrow">&rarr;</span> You can
                eat soft foods sooner, and you can be more aggressive with your salt intake.
            </div>
            <div class="question-item">
                <span class="question-label">Are you craving sugar?</span>
                If <strong>YES</strong> <span class="action-arrow">&rarr;</span> <strong>DON'T GIVE IN.</strong> A big
                sugar spike now will slow your body's deep healing as it will be viewed as a stressor. Slowly ramp up
                carbs.
            </div>
            <div class="question-item">
                <span class="question-label">Are you craving salt?</span>
                If <strong>YES</strong> <span class="action-arrow">&rarr;</span> <strong>BE CAREFUL.</strong> A big
                salt spike now may cause edema and swelling. Sometimes you may try a little bit of salt to see if it
                improves signs of low sodium (hyponatremia).

        <h2>Why Eat Carbs instead of Meat or Fat?</h2>
        <p>You might wonder why we use simple carbs like rice and fruit instead of meat and fat. It’s because your body
            is in a very special state after a dry fast.</p>

        <div class="guiding-questions" style="border-left-color: #e67e22; background-color: #fef5e7;">
            <h3>The Three Main Goals</h3>
            <p>Your body has three big jobs to do during the refeed:</p>

            <div class="question-item">
                <span class="question-label">1. Waking Up Your Digestion:</span>
                Your stomach has been "sleeping." It <strong>cannot digest heavy food</strong> yet. Meat and fat are too
                hard to process right now. Carbs are the fastest and easiest way to give your body energy.
            </div>

            <div class="question-item">
                <span class="question-label">2. Managing Sugar Levels:</span>
                After a fast, your body is temporarily "sugar sensitive." <strong>Huge sugar spikes</strong> can cause
                problems. But you still need some carbs to fix this sensitivity. We use slow, gentle carbs (like rice
                and fruit) to help you heal without causing a crash.
            </div>

            <div class="question-item">
                <span class="question-label">3. Fueling New Cells:</span>
                Your body is in a <strong>healing frenzy</strong>. It is making new stem cells that need lots of energy
                to rebuild your tissues. Carbs provide the fastest and cleanest fuel for this "repair crew."
            </div>
        </div>

        <p><strong>Why Simple Carbs Work Best:</strong> Foods like white rice, coconut water, and soft fruit are the
            best way to start. They provide quick energy without stressing your stomach. For the first 5 days, you
            should eat <strong>almost zero protein and fat</strong>. This helps:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Turn on your thyroid hormones</li>
            <li>Fix how your body processes sugar</li>
            <li>Get the most out of your new stem cells</li>
            <li>Let your digestive system wake up slowly</li>
        </ul>

        <p><em>Once you feel stable (usually Day 6 or 7), you can slowly add fats and meat. Rushing this can stop your
                body from healing.</em></p>

        <h2 id="bioenergetic-refeed">Style 1: Bioenergetic Style Refeeding</h2>
        <p><strong>Goal: Metabolic Recovery & Stem Cell Optimization.</strong> This style is the standard for the Scorch
            Protocol. It uses controlled, high-quality carbohydrates to rapidly signal the body that the period of
            scarcity is over, triggering the "healing frenzy" of new stem cells and restarting thyroid hormone
            production.</p>
        <p>Follow this schedule closely to calm your immune system and protect your new stem cells. If you usually eat
            very few carbs, start with smaller portions of rice and fruit. You must add meat and fat very slowly to
            avoid sugar problems.</p>

            <h3>For Patients in "Metabolic Torpor"</h3>
            <p>This method is designed for patients who feel <strong>"stuck" in fat metabolism</strong>. If you have
                been restricted or in a ketogenic state for a long time, your body may have lost the ability to process
                carbohydrates effectively. This is not simple malabsorption, but a protective state of torpor where
                glucose oxidation has been "switched off" to preserve life.</p>
            <p>This plan utilizes a very slow, liquid-led transition to gradually re-awaken your metabolic engines,
                building the body's resilience before attempting the more aggressive bioenergetic recovery (Style 1).

        <div class="guiding-questions" style="border-left-color: #9b59b6; background-color: #f4ecf7;">
            <h3>Protecting Against EBV & HSV Flares</h3>
            <p>For those with latent viruses like Epstein-Barr (EBV) or Herpes (HSV), the refeed is a high-risk period.
                When you break a fast, you lose the protective effects of ketosis. Combined with high cortisol and
                refeeding stress, this can trigger "viral reactivation", leading to cold sores, extreme fatigue, or
                heavy brain fog. Sometimes this makes the refeed feel much worse than it should and that's our clue to
                implement the viral reactivation protocol.</p>

        <h2>The "Danger Window": Protecting Your New Cells</h2>
        <div class="guidance-box" style="border-left: 5px solid #c0392b; background-color: #fceae9; color: #7b241c;">
            <h3>⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT WARNING</h3>
            <p><strong>This is critical if you are worried about cancer.</strong> Your body is growing very fast during
                the refeed phase.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Your body is currently using <strong>new stem cells</strong> to repair itself. This is a great time for
            healing, but it is also a time when your cells are vulnerable. If you are exposed to <strong>toxic chemicals
                (mutagens)</strong> right now, your body might accidentally build damaged cells instead of healthy ones.
        </p>

        <p>Because your body is in a state of rapid growth, you must <strong>refeed very slowly</strong> to keep your
            cell growth under control. Avoid anything that could damage your DNA during this time.</p>
