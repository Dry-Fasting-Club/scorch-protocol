            style="background-color: #fff3cd; color: #856404; padding: 15px; border: 1px solid #ffeeba; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 20px; text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">
            ⚠️ UNDER CONSTRUCTION ⚠️<br>
            <span style="font-weight: normal;">This section is still being finished. The information here is an early
                version.</span>
        </div>

        <p>This phase is about using Human Growth Hormone (hGH) to help your body repair deep tissues and fix your
            immune system. Yannick has used this himself and with his clients to get amazing results. Everyone’s body is
            a little different, so we have to carefully figure out how it works for you.</p>

        <div class="guiding-questions">
            <h3>How hGH Helps You Heal</h3>
            <p><strong>Fixing Your Immune System.</strong><br>
                Dry fasting cleans out the "trash," and hGH sends the signal to "rebuild." Its main job in this plan is
                to rebuild your <strong>Thymus Gland</strong>. This gland is like a school for your immune system.
                Doctors have found that using hGH can actually make your immune system young again.</p>

            <p><strong>The "Big Three": Fasting, T3, and hGH working together</strong><br>
                For many people, using hGH by itself doesn't work. To truly heal, you need all three parts of the Scorch
                Protocol to work together:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Phase 1: The Cleanup (Dry Fasting):</strong> This cleans out the debris and old proteins
                    that are blocking your body's healing signals.</li>
                <li><strong>Phase 2: The Power (T3 Therapy):</strong> This turns your body's power back on. You can't
                    rebuild your body if you don't have enough energy (ATP) to do the work.</li>
                <li><strong>Phase 3: The Rebuild (hGH):</strong> Once the trash is gone and the power is on, hGH gives
                    the command to build new, healthy cells and "power plants" (mitochondria).</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <div
                style="background-color: #f0f4f8; border-left: 5px solid #2980b9; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px; margin: 2rem 0;">
                <h4 style="margin-top: 0; color: #2c3e50;">A New Way to Look at Chronic Illness</h4>
                <p>Doctors now believe that some chronic illnesses trap the body in a cycle of inflammation where low
                    growth hormone levels stop the body from repairing itself. Using hGH helps your body stop burning
                    sugar inefficiently and starts using its best fuel source for energy again.</p>
                <p><strong>How long does it take?</strong> Studies show that people with low growth hormone often need
                    <strong>9 months of treatment</strong> to feel better. Be patient—it takes time to rebuild your
                    body's energy and reverse your symptoms.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p><strong>Why Fasting isn't Always Enough:</strong> While fasting helps your body make more growth hormone
                at first, doing it too much or not eating enough can actually lower your hormone levels later on.</p>
            <p><strong>What the Research Says:</strong> One study showed that "starvation" could drop growth hormone
                levels by <strong>up to 50%</strong> for several months. This means some people may need extra hGH
                support to make sure their body keeps healing after a fast.</p>

        <div class="guiding-questions" style="border-left-color: #582fca; background-color: #f8f6ff;">
            <h3>How hGH Helps You Burn Fat</h3>
            <p>During a fast, your body makes more growth hormone to help you burn fat for fuel. This is what helps your
                body make ketones, which your brain uses for energy when you aren't eating.</p>

            <p><strong>The "Over-Fasting" Problem:</strong> If you fast too often or for too long, your body might stop
                making enough growth hormone. When this happens, you might notice that you aren't losing much fat
                anymore, even if you aren't eating. You might also feel more tired or take longer to recover. Some
                people mistake this for being sick again and try to fast more, but that only makes the problem worse.
                This is why we focus on using hGH to break that cycle.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="guiding-questions" style="border-left-color: #2ecc71; background-color: #eafaf1;">
            <h3>Rebuilding Muscle, Not Fat</h3>
            <p>One of the hardest parts of the Scorch Protocol is the <strong>Refeeding Phase</strong>. After a long
                fast, your body is desperate for food. If your hormones aren't balanced, your body will want to store
                all that new food as fat instead of muscle.</p>

            <p><strong>The Fix:</strong> This is where hGH therapy helps. It tells your body to use those nutrients to
                rebuild your muscles and organs instead of just making you gain fat.</p>

            <div class="question-item">
                <span class="question-label">What the Science Shows:</span>
                <p>A study on animals showed a big difference between just eating again and eating while using hGH:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Without hGH:</strong> Rebuilding body weight was slow, and they didn't gain extra
                        muscle.</li>
                    <li><strong>With hGH:</strong> They rebuilt their body weight in just **9 weeks** and actually grew
                        more muscle than they had before.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Using hGH while you start eating again ensures your body becomes stronger and leaner than it was
                    before you started.</p>

            <h3>Where to Get hGH</h3>
            <p>It is very important to get high-quality hGH, as many products sold online are fake or low-quality.</p>
            <p>One trusted source for Human Growth Hormone is <strong><a href="https://chronic-illness.ca"
                        target="_blank" style="color: #2980b9;">chronic-illness.ca</a></strong>. They have high-quality
                products and can ship worldwide.</p>
