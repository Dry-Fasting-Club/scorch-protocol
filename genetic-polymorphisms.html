        <h1>Genetic Variants: Matching Your Scorch Protocol to Your DNA</h1>
        <p>Dry fasting in the Scorch Protocol speeds up your metabolism. However, it can backfire if your genes make it
            hard for your body to use thyroid hormones (T3). Understanding your DNA helps you change the protocol so it
            is safe and works best for you.</p>

        <div class="guiding-questions" style="border-left-color: #9b59b6; background-color: #f4ecf7;">
            <h3>Why Your Genes Matter for Fasting</h3>
            <div class="question-item">
                <span class="question-label">The Main Problem</span>
                Certain gene variants lower your ability to create active thyroid hormone by <strong>20-40%</strong>.
                This can make the natural slowdown from fasting much worse. It can lead to feeling very tired, gaining
                weight back quickly, or causing health problems to flare up.
            </div>
            <div class="question-item">
                <span class="question-label">The Opportunity</span>
                These genes explain <strong>5-15%</strong> of how your thyroid works. Changing your fast based on your
                DNA can cut your risks by <strong>50%</strong> while helping your body repair itself more deeply.
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>The Main Variant: DIO2 Thr92Ala (rs225014)</h2>
        <p><strong>What it does:</strong> This gene variant lowers the amount of active thyroid hormone (T3) in your
            muscles, brain, and fat. People with this variant (about 12-50% of the population) often have a 10-20%
            slower resting metabolism. This can lead to a higher body weight and higher blood sugar.</p>

        <div class="guiding-questions" style="border-left-color: #e74c3c; background-color: #fadbd8;">
            <h3>Fasting Risks for DIO2 Carriers</h3>
            <div class="question-item">
                <span class="question-label">The Danger</span>
                Normally, dry fasting drops T3 levels by 20-50%. People with this gene can see their levels drop by
                <strong>40% or more</strong>. This puts them at risk for losing muscle, having blood sugar spikes, and
                gaining weight back right after the fast.
            </div>
            <div class="question-item">
                <span class="question-label">The Reason</span>
                It creates a hidden "slow thyroid" state. This mimics the stress your body feels during a sickness like
                COVID, leading to brain fog and a stalled metabolism.
            </div>
        </div>

        <h3>Actionable Steps for DIO2 Carriers</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Test Your DNA:</strong> Upload Ancestry.com raw data to Promethease; flag if Thr/Ala or Ala/Ala.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Modify Fasting:</strong> Start with wet fasts (12-16h); limit dry fasts to <24h initially.</li>
            <li><strong>Track Biomarkers:</strong> Monitor FT3/TSH pre/post-fast to catch crashes early.</li>
            <li><strong>Selenium Support:</strong> Add 200mcg/day to boost deiodinase activity by 20%.</li>
            <li><strong>Consider T3 Therapy:</strong> If carrier with stubborn hypothyroid symptoms, consult for LT3
                (liothyronine).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Keto-DIO2 Metabolic Trap</h3>
        <p>Research on keto diets shows that the body usually adapts well to burning fat. For most people, a drop in
            thyroid hormone on keto is just the body being efficient. However, this idea ignores a major problem for
            people with certain genes.</p>

        <div class="guiding-questions" style="border-left-color: #e67e22; background-color: #fef5e7;">
            <h3>Why DIO2 Carriers Struggle on Keto</h3>
            <p>The DIO2 variant (rs225014) is very common, affecting <strong>12-56% of people</strong>. It makes it hard
                for your body to create active thyroid hormone, and it makes the normal "keto slowdown" much worse.</p>

            <h4>What Happens to Carriers:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Low Energy in Cells:</strong> Low T3 levels inside your cells make it harder for your body
                    to create energy (ATP).</li>
                <li><strong>Insulin Problems:</strong> Low T3 makes it harder for your body to use sugar, which can lead
                    to storing more fat.</li>
                <li><strong>High Stress:</strong> A slow metabolism can keep your body in a "stress mode," raising your
                    cortisol levels.</li>
                <li><strong>Slow Fat Burning:</strong> Even if you are in ketosis, your body may still be very slow at
                    burning fat for fuel.</li>
                <li><strong>Lasting Symptoms:</strong> You might still feel tired, cold, or have brain fog even after
                    you start eating carbs again.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>The Low-Energy Trap:</strong> This slowdown traps your cells in a defensive state. What should be
                a healthy adaptation becomes a metabolic prison that is hard to escape.</p>
        </div>

        <p><strong>The Solution:</strong> You must test your genes for the DIO2 variant. If you have it, you should
            prioritize diets that include healthy carbs and support your thyroid, rather than following a standard keto
            diet. This keeps your metabolism running instead of hitting a dead end.</p>

        <div class="guiding-questions" style="border-left-color: #3498db; background-color: #ebf5fb;">
            <h3>Where You Come From: Who Is at Risk?</h3>
            <p>The DIO2 variant is found at different rates around the world. <strong>People with European ancestors are
                    at the highest risk</strong>, and have some of the highest carrier rates in the world.</p>
