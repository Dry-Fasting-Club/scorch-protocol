        <h2>1. Low Energy & Fatigue</h2>
        <p><strong>The Cause:</strong> Your body’s "power plants" (mitochondria) are sleeping or have low electrical
            power.</p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td style="width: 30%;"><strong>What to Eat</strong></td>
                <td>Eat foods that give you clean energy and help your body process sugar.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td style="width: 30%;"><strong>Adrenal Support</strong></td>
                <td>Help your stress glands by getting enough Vitamin C and salt, and by reducing stress.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Protocol Fixes</strong></td>
                <td>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Dry Fasting:</strong> Cleans out weak "power plants" (mitochondria).</li>
                        <li><strong>T3 Therapy:</strong> Directly speeds up your metabolism and energy production.</li>
                        <li><strong>Recharging:</strong> Being outside in the sun and grounding helps increase your
                            body's "battery" charge.</li>
                    </ul>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h2>2. Fungal Issues (Candida/Mold)</h2>
        <p><strong>The Cause:</strong> A weak immune system and a low body temperature let fungus grow too easily.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>T3 Therapy:</strong> Raising your body temperature to 37°C (98.6°F) makes it hard for fungus to
                live.</li>
            <li><strong>Immune Restart:</strong> Building a stronger immune system helps your body fight off fungus
                naturally.</li>
            <li><strong>Supplements:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Fluconazole:</strong> A strong medicine used for several months for serious fungal
                        problems.</li>
                    <li><strong>Monolaurin:</strong> A natural supplement from coconut that helps the immune system and
                        the liver.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Kidney Issues</h2>
        <p><strong>The Cause:</strong> Your kidneys are working hard to clean out toxins and may need help with blood
            flow.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>T3 Therapy:</strong> Helps blood flow through the kidneys so they can filter better.</li>
            <li><strong>Lemon Water:</strong> Drink lemon water (when not dry fasting) to help prevent kidney stones.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Potassium:</strong> Helps keep your pee healthy and prevents crystals from forming.</li>
            <li><strong>Dry Fasting:</strong> Can help the kidneys heal and clean themselves out if done correctly.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Liver Issues</h2>
        <p><strong>The Cause:</strong> A fatty liver or being overwhelmed by toxins during healing.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Dry Fasting:</strong> The best way to burn fat out of the liver.</li>
            <li><strong>TUDCA:</strong> A supplement that helps thin out bile and protects your liver cells. This is
                very important.</li>
            <li><strong>T3 Therapy:</strong> Speeds up the liver so it can process fat and energy faster.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Blood Sugar Problems (Insulin Resistance)</h2>
        <p><strong>The Cause:</strong> Your cells are "refusing" to take in sugar, which leads to high blood sugar and
            inflammation.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Diet:</strong> You can use a low-carb diet for quick results, but the real goal is to fix how
                your body uses energy.</li>
            <li><strong>Fasting:</strong> Deep fasting cleans out the cells and helps them start accepting sugar again.
                You must eventually re-introduce carbs to fully heal this.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Muscle Wasting</h2>
        <p><strong>The Cause:</strong> Your body is breaking down muscle instead of fat because you are sick or your
            immune system is weak.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>HGH (Human Growth Hormone):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Helps stop muscle loss and helps your muscles grow.</li>
                    <li>Helps rebuild your immune system (especially the thymus gland).</li>
                    <li><strong>Note:</strong> We use very low doses just to keep your muscle, not for bodybuilding.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Amino Acids:</strong> Taking certain protein supplements (Amino Acids) helps tell your body to
                keep its muscle.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Cell Power (Electricity)</h2>
        <p><strong>The Cause:</strong> Healthy cells are like batteries—they need a strong electrical charge to work.
            When you are sick, your cells lose their charge. This means they can't clean themselves out or heal
            properly.</p>

        <div class="guiding-questions" style="border-left-color: #3498db; background-color: #ebf5fb;">
            <h3>The 3 Best Ways to Recharge Your Body</h3>
            <p>While things like walking barefoot on grass (grounding) are good, these three methods are <strong>much
                    stronger</strong> for fixing your body's electricity:</p>
        </div>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <td style="width: 30%;"><strong>1. Electric Healing</strong></td>
                <td>
                    <strong>How it Works:</strong> Using special machines to send gentle electrical currents into your
                    body. This can "force" your cells to recharge, which tells them to start healing and building new
                    tissue.
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>2. Dry Fasting</strong></td>
                <td>
                    <strong>How it Works:</strong> When you stop drinking water, your cells have to work harder to
                    survive. They tighten up and become more efficient, which naturally increases their electrical
                    charge. It’s like a "reset" button for your cells.
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>3. T3 Therapy</strong></td>
                <td>
                    <strong>How it Works:</strong> Thyroid hormones (T3) give your cells the energy they need to keep
                    their "pumps" running. These pumps are what keep the electricity inside your cells. Without enough
                    T3, your cells run out of power and go into "hibernation."
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p><strong>Why These are Better than Grounding:</strong> Grounding (walking outside) is helpful for reducing
            inflammation, but it isn't strong enough to fully recharge a sick cell. Dry fasting and T3 therapy actually
            <strong>force</strong> your cells to build up and keep their electrical charge, which is necessary for deep
            healing.
