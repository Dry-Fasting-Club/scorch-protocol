        <h1>Weight Loss with The Scorch Protocol</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; color: #e74c3c; font-weight: bold;">⚠️ UNDER CONSTRUCTION</p>

        <div class="guiding-questions" style="border-left-color: #e74c3c; background-color: #fadbd8;">
            <h3>Critical Warning: Too Powerful for Casual Use</h3>
            <p>The Scorch Protocol is <strong>not designed primarily for weight loss</strong>. It is a metabolic reset
                tool for chronic illness. However, weight loss is an inevitable side effect—and it can be
                <strong>dangerously effective</strong>.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>The Problem: Overshooting Your Target</h2>
        <p>If you are simply looking to lose an insane amount of weight safely, you <strong>should work with Yannick
                Wolfe</strong> to avoid critical pitfalls.</p>

        <div class="guiding-questions" style="border-left-color: #f39c12; background-color: #fef9e7;">
            <h3>The 10-Pound Rule</h3>
            <div class="question-item">
                <span class="question-label">Stop Early</span>
                You should <strong>stop fasting at least 10 lbs BEFORE you become underweight</strong>.
            </div>
            <div class="question-item">
                <span class="question-label">Why?</span>
                The metabolic restabilization during T3 Therapy and the post-refeed period can often remove
                <strong>another 10 lbs</strong> even after you've stopped fasting.
            </div>
            <div class="question-item">
                <span class="question-label">The Risk</span>
                If you push too far, you may end up dangerously underweight, with muscle wasting and hormonal collapse.

        <h2>The Power of Dry Fasting for Weight Loss</h2>
        <p>While the Scorch Protocol is primarily designed for metabolic healing, <strong>dry fasting has proven to be
                one of the most powerful tools for permanent weight loss</strong>. Many people have successfully used
            dry fasting to lose large amounts of fat, and keep it off.</p>

        <div class="guiding-questions" style="border-left-color: #27ae60; background-color: #eafaf1;">
            <h3>Why Dry Fasting Works for Fat Loss</h3>
            <div class="question-item">
                <span class="question-label">Permanent Results</span>
                Unlike crash diets, dry fasting resets your metabolism at the cellular level. Many people report
                <strong>permanent weight loss</strong> without the typical rebound.
            </div>
            <div class="question-item">
                <span class="question-label">No Loose Skin</span>
                One of the most remarkable benefits: the ability to lose large amounts of fat <strong>without getting
                    loose skin</strong>. The dehydration stress triggers osmotic autophagy, which rapidly re-elasticizes
                the skin and consumes excess tissue when water is scarce.
            </div>
            <div class="question-item">
                <span class="question-label">Feel Empowered</span>
                If you prepare well and follow the protocol carefully, <strong>you can do this yourself</strong>.
                Experimentation is fine, many people have found their own rhythm with dry fasting for sustainable fat
                loss.
            </div>
        </div>

        <p><strong>You don't need to be dependent on anyone.</strong> With proper preparation (biomarker testing,
            genetic awareness, electrolyte loading), you can safely explore dry fasting for weight loss on your own
            terms. The protocol is here to guide you.</p>

        <h2>⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING: Children Under 18</h2>
        <div class="guiding-questions" style="border-left-color: #e74c3c; background-color: #fadbd8;">
            <h3>DO NOT Dry Fast if You Are Under 18</h3>
            <p><strong>Dry fasting is NOT recommended for children or teenagers.</strong> Yes, it is tempting for kids
                to dive into this. The risk of permanently
                lowering your metabolism during critical developmental years is too high. Children naturally should have
                a high metabolic rate, dry fasting can disrupt this.</p>

            <h4>If You're a Child/Teen with Metabolism Issues:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Start with Diet:</strong> Focus on a dietary shift to increase T3 and lower PUFAs/chemicals.
                    Eat whole foods, avoid seed oils, and prioritize nutrient-dense meals.</li>
                <li><strong>Get a DNA Test:</strong> Consider genetic testing (Ancestry.com + Promethease) to look for
                    metabolism issues like DIO2 Thr92Ala or thyroid variants.</li>
                <li><strong>Talk to Your Doctor:</strong> If diet doesn't work, discuss T3 therapy with a medical
                    professional. This is a safer option than dry fasting for young people.</li>
                <li><strong>Dry Fasting = Last Resort Only:</strong> Only consider dry fasting if all other options have
                    failed and under strict medical supervision. The risks outweigh the benefits for developing bodies.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <h2>Why This May Require Expert Guidance</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Individual Variation:</strong> Some people lose weight rapidly during the fast, others during
                the T3 phase.</li>
            <li><strong>Body Composition:</strong> You need to preserve lean mass while losing fat, this requires
                precise
                timing and supplementation.</li>
            <li><strong>Psychological Factors:</strong> The protocol can trigger disordered eating patterns if not
                monitored.</li>
            <li><strong>Rebound Prevention:</strong> Without proper metabolic reset, weight can return aggressively.
            </li>
        </ul>
