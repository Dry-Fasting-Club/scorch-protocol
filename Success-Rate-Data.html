        <h1>Success Rate Data: The Scorch Protocol Results</h1>
        <p>This page presents real data from participants who have completed The Scorch Protocol, showing
            measurable improvements across multiple chronic illness symptoms. All data is based on
            <a href="https://www.dryfastingclub.com/the-data-behind-fatigue-brain-fog-insomnia-dry-fasting-and-the-scorch-protocol/"
                target="_blank">tracked studies from the Dry Fasting Club</a>. All data is anonymized and aggregated
            from the participants,
            all of whom worked 1on1 with Yannick Wolfe.
        </p>

            <h3>Key Findings</h3>
            <div class="question-item">
                <span class="question-label">97% Success Rate</span>
                After completing the full Scorch Protocol (including T3 Therapy),
                <strong>97% of participants</strong> experienced significant improvement in their symptoms.
            </div>
            <div class="question-item">
                <span class="question-label">Symptom Tracking</span>
                Participants rated symptoms on a scale of 1-10 (10 being normal/healthy).
                Most participants started at 5 or lower, with many achieving scores of 9-10 after treatment.
            </div>
            <div class="question-item">
                <span class="question-label">Combined Approach</span>
                The combination of dry fasting and T3 therapy together creates results that
                <strong>cannot be achieved with either treatment alone</strong>.
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>Key Symptom Improvement Data</h2>
        <p>Fatigue, Brain Fog, and Insomnia are among the most common and debilitating symptoms in Long Covid, ME/CFS,
            and autoimmune conditions.
            The data shows remarkable improvements through each phase of the protocol. Participants rated symptoms on a
            scale of 1-10,
            where <strong>10 represents normal/healthy</strong> and 1 represents severe symptoms.</p>

        <h3>Before Scorch Protocol (141 Participants)</h3>
        <p>Before starting the protocol, most participants were experiencing severe symptoms:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fatigue:</strong> 27.7% rated themselves at level 1 (most severe), with 17% at level 5</li>
            <li><strong>Brain Fog:</strong> 24.8% rated themselves at level 1, with 18.4% at level 5</li>
            <li><strong>Insomnia:</strong> 25.5% rated themselves at level 1, with 16.3% at level 5</li>
            <li>Most participants scored <strong>5 or lower</strong> across all three symptoms</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>After 5-Day Dry Fast (117 Participants)</h3>
        <p>The transformation after the dry fast is remarkable:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fatigue:</strong> 31.6% reached level 10 (normal), with many others in the 8-9 range</li>
            <li><strong>Brain Fog:</strong> 29.1% reached level 10, showing significant cognitive improvement</li>
            <li><strong>Insomnia:</strong> 35% reached level 10, with 13.7% at level 9</li>
            <li>Many participants improved from the 5-9 range into <strong>level 10 (normal/healthy)</strong></li>
            <li>Those who reached 10 did not need T3 Therapy—the preparation, dry fast, and refeeding were sufficient
            </li>
            <li>Participants who improved significantly often considered themselves healed after 1-2 months of refeeding
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>After T3 Therapy Cycle (32 Participants)</h3>
        <p>For those who continued to T3 Therapy, the results are exceptional:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fatigue:</strong> 40.6% reached level 10, with 18.8% at level 8 and 12.5% at levels 7 and 9</li>
            <li><strong>Brain Fog:</strong> 53.1% reached level 10—over half achieved normal cognitive function</li>
            <li><strong>Insomnia:</strong> 56.3% reached level 10—more than half achieved normal sleep</li>
            <li><strong>97% of participants</strong> experienced significant improvement after T3 Therapy</li>
            <li>The combination of dry fasting + T3 therapy creates <strong>miraculous results</strong> that cannot be
                achieved separately</li>
        </ul>

            <div class="question-item">
                <span class="question-label">Before Protocol</span>
                Most participants (25-28%) rated their symptoms at level 1 (most severe),
                with the majority scoring 5 or lower across Fatigue, Brain Fog, and Insomnia.
            </div>
            <div class="question-item">
                <span class="question-label">After Dry Fast</span>
                A dramatic shift occurred: 30-35% of participants reached level 10 (normal/healthy)
                for each symptom, with many others achieving levels 8-9.
            </div>
            <div class="question-item">
                <span class="question-label">After T3 Therapy</span>
                For those who continued, over 40% reached level 10 for Fatigue, and over 50%

            <h3>Important Notes About the Data</h3>
            <div class="question-item">
                <span class="question-label">Sample Size</span>
                Sample sizes naturally decrease as participants progress through the protocol.
                This is because many participants feel significantly better after earlier phases
                and consider themselves healed, or face financial/time constraints.
            </div>
            <div class="question-item">
                <span class="question-label">Most Motivated Participants</span>
                The participants who complete the full protocol tend to be those who are
                <strong>much sicker and really motivated to heal</strong>. This self-selection
                means the data represents those with more severe cases.
            </div>
            <div class="question-item">
                <span class="question-label">T3 Availability</span>
                Some participants dropped out due to difficulty obtaining T3, especially
                slow-release T3. This is why <a href="https://chronic-illness.ca" target="_blank">chronic-illness.ca</a>
                was created to help patients access necessary medications.
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>What This Means For You</h2>
        <p>The data shows that The Scorch Protocol offers real hope for those suffering from Long Covid,
            ME/CFS, autoimmune conditions, and other chronic illnesses. The combination of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Strategic Preparation</strong> (ketosis, anti-parasitics, anti-fungals)</li>
            <li><strong>5-Day Dry Fast</strong> (intense autophagy and stem cell activation)</li>
            <li><strong>Proper Refeeding</strong> (stem cell proliferation and tissue regeneration)</li>
            <li><strong>T3 Therapy</strong> (metabolic reset and energy restoration)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>...creates a powerful healing cascade that addresses the root causes of chronic illness,
            not just the symptoms.</p>
