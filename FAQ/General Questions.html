        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h1>
        <p>Common questions about the Scorch Protocol, simplified for clear understanding.</p>

        <div class="guiding-questions">
            <h3>1. Is dry fasting safe?</h3>
            <p>Dry fasting is a powerful tool, but it must be done carefully. For most healthy people, short supervised
                fasts are safe. However, if you have kidney disease (severe), heart problems (severe), or are pregnant,
                you should <strong>not</strong> dry fast. Always follow the preparation and refeeding rules to stay
                safe.</p>

            <h3>2. Why do I need T3 therapy?</h3>
            <p>Many people with chronic illness have a "low-power" metabolism. Their body is in hibernation mode. T3
                therapy helps "restart" your body's heater and gives your cells the energy they need to heal. Without
                it, some people find they don't get better even with fasting.</p>

            <h3>3. What is "Tissue-Level Resistance"?</h3>
            <p>This is when your blood tests look normal, but the T3 hormone isn't actually getting into your cells.
                It's like having a key that won't fit the lock. T3 therapy helps force those "locks" open so your body
                can finally use the energy it has.</p>

            <h3>4. Can I skip the preparation phase?</h3>
            <p><strong>No.</strong> Skipping preparation (like the Ketovore diet or juice cleanse) can make the fast
                much harder and even dangerous. Preparation gets your body ready to burn fat and cleans out your system
                so you don't feel as sick during the fast.</p>

            <h3>5. Why is the refeeding phase so dangerous?</h3>
            <p>When you haven't eaten for days, your body is very sensitive. If you eat the wrong foods (like heavy fats
                meat, too much carbs at once, or nuts) too early, you can cause swelling, kidney stress, or "refeeding
                syndrome." Following
                the 7-day protocol ensures your body heals correctly. Long-term carnivore dieters may have trouble with
                the refeed phase because they have lost the ability to utilize carbs.</p>

            <h3>6. What if I lose too much weight?</h3>
            <p>Weight loss is normal during a fast, but much of it is water. Most people gain some weight back during
                the refeed. The 9-Month BMR Reconstruction plan is designed to show you that most participants regained
                much more weight after a long period of starvation, indicating that your metabolism slows down
                significantly after a fast (probably not as much compared to a restrictive diet which is more indicative
                of starvation). Point being, if you don't have a pancreatic insulin problem then you will regain weight
                after a fast if eating enough calories.</p>

            <h3>7. Why do I need hGH therapy?</h3>
            <p>Growth Hormone (hGH) is the signal that tells your body to "rebuild." hGH helps build new, healthy cells
                and improves your immune system. It's the final step in the
                advanced regeneration process. hGH therapy is not necessary for everyone, but it can be extremely
                helpful considering many chronic illnesses are associated with low hGH pituitary secretion.</p>

            <h3>8. Can I drink water during a dry fast?</h3>
            <p>In a <strong>true</strong> dry fast, you do not drink any water or eat any food. This forces your body to
                create "internal water" by burning fat. This process is much more powerful for healing than a water
                fast.</p>

            <h3>9. What should I do if my heart races?</h3>
            <p>If your resting heart rate goes above 100 beats per minute during T3 therapy or fasting, <strong>stop
                    increasing</strong> your dose or consider breaking the fast. Always prioritize safety and listen to
                your body's warning signs. For T3 over 100 beats during rest is indicative of going too high. For
                fasting, it is also tracked during rest. </p>

            <h3>10. How long does the whole protocol take?</h3>
            <p>The fast may only last a few days, but the full recovery—including refeeding, metabolic reconstruction,
                and hormone therapy, can take <strong>6 to 12 months</strong>. Healing deep, chronic issues is a
                marathon, not a sprint. Sometimes your symptoms may indicate extra fasts being necessary.</p>
