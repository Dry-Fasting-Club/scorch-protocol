        <h1>Refeeding: The Art of Landing</h1>
        <p>Refeeding is not just "eating again." It is a biological surgery where you reconstruct your microbiome,
            hormones, and immune system. The following questions integrate findings from the Khoroshilov Thesis (1994)
            with the Scorch Protocol's metabolic objectives.</p>

        <div class="guiding-questions">

            <!-- Q1: Importance -->
            <div class="question-item">
                <h3>1. Why do you say the refeed is "dangerous"?</h3>
                <div class="answer-text">
                    <p>Because your body has switched its machinery entirely to fat oxidation. Your pancreas has stopped
                        making insulin, and your stomach acid is low. If you dump a complex meal (steak and potatoes) or
                        too much salt into this system, you risk <strong>Refeeding Syndrome</strong>: massive fluid
                        retention, electrolyte antagonism, and renal stress. You must "wake up" the machinery slowly.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-data-box">
                    <strong>🧪 The Research (Khoroshilov 1994):</strong><br>
                    The study emphasizes that the refeeding period is critical for "consolidating therapeutic effects."
                    It notes that improper refeeding (too fast, or wrong foods) was the primary cause of adverse
                    reactions like edema and intestinal colic in the 13% of dropout cases.
                </div>
            </div>

            <!-- Q2: Modifications / Speed Up -->
            <div class="question-item">
                <h3>2. Can I speed up the refeed? I feel fine after 1 day.</h3>
                <div class="answer-text">
                    <p><strong>Yes, but with conditions.</strong> The "Slow Refeed" is a safety buffer. If you have done
                        multiple fasts, or better yet, if you have completed the <strong>T3 Therapy Phase</strong> and
                        your basal metabolic rate (body temp) is consistently high (>37°C), your digestive enzymes and
                        insulin sensitivity are likely more robust.</p>
                    <p>In this specific case, you can compress the "Liquid Phase" (Day 1) into 12 hours instead of 24.
                        However, the rule of <strong>Zero Fat/Zero Protein</strong> for the first few days remains
                        non-negotiable to prevent insulin resistance rebound.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <!-- Q3: Kempner vs Study -->
            <div class="question-item">
                <h3>3. Many protocols recommends vegetable broth or bone broth. You recommend fruit and rice. Why?</h3>
                <div class="answer-text">
                    <p>This is the difference between a "Hygienic/Clinical Model" and a "Metabolic/Bio-Energetic Model."
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Clinical Model:</strong> Focuses on gentle rehydration and electrolytes
                        (Broth, Veg Juice). This is safer for the gut but slower for energy.</p>
                    <p><strong>Metabolic Model:</strong> Focuses on spiking the thyroid and fueling
                        stem cells. We use simple sugars (Fruit/Rice) to signal "abundance" to the hypothalamus
                        immediately. This creates a stronger hormonal rebound but requires strict avoidance of fat to
                        work safely.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-data-box">
                    <strong>🧪 Analysis:</strong><br>
                    Khoroshilov's data supports starting with 100-200mL of water/broth to avoid "washout." The Scorch
                    Protocol adapts this by using Coconut Water (nature's isotonic broth) to achieve the same hydration
                    safety while adding the glucose needed for T3 conversion.

            <!-- Q4: Salt Cravings -->
            <div class="question-item">
                <h3>4. I am craving salt like crazy. Can I have just a pinch?</h3>
                <div class="answer-text">
                    <p><strong>Caution.</strong> Your kidneys have been hoarding sodium for days (Aldosterone is high).
                        If you add dietary salt now, while Aldosterone is still high, your body will super-saturate with
                        water. This causes the "puffiness" or Edema.</p>
                    <p>However, if you feel dizzy or have low blood pressure (Hyponatremia symptoms), a tiny pinch under
                        the tongue is a medical necessity. Use your symptoms, not your cravings, as the guide.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <!-- Q5: Edema -->
            <div class="question-item">
                <h3>5. My ankles are swollen (Edema) on Day 3. Did I ruin it?</h3>
                <div class="answer-text">
                    <p>You didn't ruin the healing, but you overstressed the kidneys. This usually means you consumed
                        sodium or simply too much volume too fast.</p>
                    <p>The fix is not easy, but sometimes requires eating a high potassium diet, or performing another
                        dry fast or sauna in the future. Often the swelling will subside by itself if you slow down with
                        the sodium.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <!-- Q6: Weight Gain -->
            <div class="question-item">
                <h3>6. I gained all the weight back in 3 days. Is that fat?</h3>
                <div class="answer-text">
                    <p><strong>No.</strong> It is physically impossible to gain 5lbs of fat in 3 days. This is
                        <strong>Glycogen Replenishment + Water Weight</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p>Every gram of carbohydrate stores ~3 grams of water. As you refill your muscles (which were
                        flat), they pull water in. This is healthy "Intracellular Hydration." Do not panic.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <!-- Q7: Protein Timing -->
            <div class="question-item">
                <h3>7. Why do I have to wait 5-7 days for meat/eggs?</h3>
                <div class="answer-text">
                    <p>Two reasons:<br>
                        1. <strong>Autophagy braking:</strong> Protein (Amino Acids) shuts down autophagy instantly. We
                        want a "soft landing" where autophagy tapers off slowly.<br>
                        2. <strong>Enzymes:</strong> Your stomach has stopped producing Pepsin (protein-digesting
                        enzyme). If you eat meat now, it will rot/ferment rather than digest.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <!-- Q8: Feeling Worse -->
            <div class="question-item">
                <h3>8. I felt great fasting, but now I feel tired and achy after eating. Why?</h3>
                <div class="answer-text">
                    <p>This is <strong>Metabolic Switching Fatigue</strong> and electrolyte rebalance. As your body
                        transitions from ketosis to glucose metabolism, it can cause fatigue and achiness. </p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <!-- Q9: Supplements -->
            <div class="question-item">
                <h3>9. Should I take probiotics or vitamins immediately?</h3>
                <div class="answer-text">
                    <p><strong>No.</strong> Your gut mucosa is "open" and sensitive. Strong supplements can irritate it.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Exception:</strong> If you suffer from HSV and/or EBV outbreaks, you can gradually
                        increase intake of herbs and monolaurin. This advice can also work for Lyme herbal protocols,
                        but must be very gently reintroduced.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <!-- Q10: Returning to Normal -->
            <div class="question-item">
                <h3>10. When can I go back to "normal" eating?</h3>
                <div class="answer-text">
                    <p>The Khoroshilov standard is: <strong>Refeed length = Fast length.</strong><br>
                        If you fasted 5 days, be strict for 5 days. After that, you are biologically "safe," but for
                        maximum tissue remodeling, the Scorch Protocol recommends extending the "High Carb/Low Fat"
                        phase for 2-4 weeks to maximize stem cell differentiation and maximize thyroid restoration.</p>
