        <h1>Phase 1: Getting Ready & Ketovore</h1>
        <p>Preparation is the most important part of a safe dry fast. Jumping into a fast after eating a standard,
            high-carb diet can lead to a severe "keto flu" and extra stress on your body. The goal is to get your body
            used to burning fat (ketosis) <em>before</em> the fast even begins.</p>

        <div class="guiding-questions">
            <h3>Readiness Checklist</h3>
            <div class="question-item">
                <span class="question-label">Are you currently drinking caffeine?</span>
                If <strong>YES</strong> <span class="action-arrow">&rarr;</span> Stop drinking it slowly 1 week before.
                Withdrawal during a dry fast feels terrible.
            </div>
            <div class="question-item">
                <span class="question-label">Is your diet high in carbs (sugar/grains)?</span>
                If <strong>YES</strong> <span class="action-arrow">&rarr;</span> Slowly lower the carbs and fiber the
                closer you get to the fast to make the transition easier.
            </div>
            <div class="question-item">
                <span class="question-label">Is your digestion regular?</span>
                If <strong>NO</strong> <span class="action-arrow">&rarr;</span> A clean colon is required. The Scorch
                Protocol standard is a coffee enema the morning before the fast, but simpler water alternatives are
                available.

            <div class="question-item">
                <span class="question-label">Blood Work Check:</span>
                Make sure your labs show: <strong>Kidneys are healthy (eGFR > 60)</strong>, <strong>Liver is healthy

                <span class="question-label">Medication Warning:</span>
                <strong>DO NOT FAST</strong> if you are taking medications that are hard on the liver (like Benzos,
                Propranolol, or Tylenol). You will need a different plan to clean your liver first.

        <h2>The Metabolic Armor: Choosing Your Prep</h2>
        <p>Your preparation strategy defines the success of your fast. Choose the path that matches your metabolic
            health.</p>

        <div class="pillar-item"
            style="background-color: #eafaf1; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 2rem; border-left: 5px solid #27ae60;">
            <h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #27ae60;">Option A: The Juicing Plan (Light Prep)</h3>
            <p><strong>Recommended for:</strong> People with no food sensitivities, those with fasting experience, or
                those who want a faster but slightly more difficult start.</p>
            <p>A strategic juicing plan can help hydrate your body and flood it with healthy enzymes. This method uses a
                "Moderate Carb Taper" to slowly lower your sugar intake before the fast while keeping your electrolytes
                high.</p>

            <div
                style="background-color: #fff; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px; border: 1px solid #dcdcdc; margin-top: 15px;">
                <h4 style="margin-top: 0;">The 3-Day Juice Prep</h4>
                <p>For the 3 days leading up to your fast, switch to a juice-only diet. This prepares your cells and
                    cleans your system without the burden of solid food.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Amount:</strong> Drink up to <strong>72 ounces</strong> of fresh juice per day.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mineral Balance:</strong> Focus on a <strong>high-potassium</strong> and
                        <strong>low-sodium</strong> diet. This helps your cells hold water more effectively before the
                        fast.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>No Fiber:</strong> Keep the juices clear. You want the nutrients and electrolytes
                        without the fiber bulk in your gut.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="pillar-item"
            style="background-color: #f4f6f6; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 2rem; border-left: 5px solid #2c3e50;">
            <h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #2c3e50;">Option B: The Ketovore Plan (Deep Healing)</h3>
            <p><strong>Recommended for:</strong> Chronic illness (Long Covid, Autoimmune), beginners, or those who get
                very sick when they stop eating sugar.</p>
            <div
                style="background-color: #fff3cd; color: #856404; padding: 15px; border: 1px solid #ffeeba; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 20px; text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">
                ⚠️ Warning ⚠️<br>
                <span style="font-weight: normal;">This plan is <strong>not</strong> for people who have already done a
                    lot of fasting and keto but are still getting sicker. You will need a more advanced strategy.</span>
            </div>
            <p>This preparation is essential for deep repair. By cutting out sugar and grains and eating mostly meat and
                healthy animal fats, you lower inflammation <em>before</em> the fast starts. This gets your body ready
                to burn fat for energy, which makes the actual fast much safer and easier. It builds "metabolic armor"
                so you don't crash when you stop eating.</p>

            <div
                style="margin-top: 1.5rem; background: #fff; border: 1px solid #dcdcdc; border-radius: 5px; padding: 1rem 1.5rem;">
                <h4 style="margin-top: 0; color: #2c3e50; border-bottom: 2px solid #eee; padding-bottom: 0.5rem;">🧬 Why
                    This Works: Quick Wins & The Long Game</h4>

                <div style="font-size: 0.95rem; line-height: 1.6;">
                    <p><strong>1. Immediate Energy Boost (Bypassing the Problem)</strong><br>
                        Your cells are currently struggling to use sugar for energy. If we force them to fast without
                        help, they crash. This diet provides <strong>backup fuel</strong> (ketones) that gives your
                        brain and body immediate energy (about 27% more). This keeps your brain working while your body
                        prepares for a deep clean.</p>

                    <p><strong>2. Early Cleaning Crew</strong><br>
                        Don't wait for the fast to start cleaning your body. This diet triggers a mild "pre-clean"
                        <em>right now</em>. By clearing out some of the junk early, you reduce the shock of the actual
                        fast. It's like taking out the trash before doing a deep spring clean.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>3. Lowering Inflammation (Putting Out the Fire)</strong><br>
                        Starting a dry fast while your body is inflamed is painful and dangerous. This diet acts like a
                        <strong>fire extinguisher</strong>, calming down the systems that cause "cytokine storms" and
                        pain. Entering the fast in a calm state is much safer.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>4. Calming Your Nerves</strong><br>
                        Fasting causes a surge of adrenaline. If you're already stressed, this can be hard to handle.
                        This diet naturally boosts a "chill" chemical in your brain (GABA), helping you stay calm and
                        stable durante el ayuno.</p>

                    <div
                        style="background-color: #2c3e50; color: #fff; padding: 12px; border-radius: 4px; margin-top: 15px;">
                        <strong>🔄 The Strategy: The Move</strong><br>
                        <em>We are not staying on this diet forever.</em> This is a tool to help you survive the
                        cleaning phase. We use this to clear out junk and keep your energy stable. <strong>Once the fast
                            is over and your body is clean, we will switch again.</strong> Our goal after the fast is to
                        eat healthy carbs that will give you a high-performance metabolism again.

            <h3>The Day Before: The Full Flush</h3>
            <p>On the day before you start your dry fast, you must clear your digestive tract and hyper-hydrate. This
                ensures no waste sits in your gut during the fast.</p>
            <div class="question-item">
                <span class="question-label">1. Morning Coffee Enema:</span>
                Performed first thing in the morning. This stimulates the liver to dump stagnant bile and clears the
                lower colon.
            </div>
            <div class="question-item">
                <span class="question-label">2. Oral Cleanse (Magnesium Citrate):</span>
                Following the enema, mix <strong>15–20 grams</strong> of magnesium citrate into 10 ounces of water.
                Drink this before noon.
            </div>
            <div class="question-item">
                <span class="question-label">3. Juicing & Electrolyte Refill:</span>
                For the rest of the day, drink up to 72oz of fresh juice (no fiber). This refills your electrolytes and
                hydration stores for the upcoming fast.
            </div>
        </div>



        <h2>Liver & Colon Cleaning</h2>
        <p>A clean colon is essential. Clinical studies show that using enemas reduces the "acidotic crisis"
            (headaches/nausea) by up to 56% (Khoroshilov). Clearing stagnant bile before you stop drinking water is the
            safest approach.</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #8e44ad;">Standard Scorch Prep</h3>
                <p>The standard protocol is the <strong>Day Before Flush</strong> described above: Morning Coffee Enema
                    (or black coffee)
                    followed by Magnesium Citrate Oral Cleanse and all-day juicing. This keeps the fast comfortable and
                    clean.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 0;"><strong>💡 Advanced Technique:</strong> You may perform the Coffee Enema 12-14
                    hours <em>into</em> the first day of the dry fast for deeper liver stimulation. (Experienced fasters
                    only).</p>
                <hr style="border: 0; border-top: 1px solid #eee; margin: 10px 0;">
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>💧 Simple Alternative:</strong> If coffee is too much, perform a
                    standard warm water enema the night before you start your fast to clear the colon without a liver
                    flush. (22% symptom improvement)</p>
