        <h1>Phase 4: T3 Thyroid Therapy (Rebooting Your Metabolism)</h1>
        <p>Many people with chronic illness are stuck in a state where their body is "hibernating" to save energy. Even
            if your blood tests look normal, your body might not be using thyroid hormones correctly. This phase uses a
            hormone called T3 to "reboot" your body’s thermostat and turn your energy back on.</p>

        <div class="guiding-questions">
            <h3>Is This Therapy Right for You?</h3>

            <h4>Main Requirements (You must have these)</h4>
            <div class="question-item">
                <span class="question-label">1. Low Waking Temperature:</span>
                Is your temperature consistently <strong>below 36.5°C (97.7°F)</strong> first thing in the morning? This
                is the main sign your metabolism is slow.
            </div>
            <div class="question-item">
                <span class="question-label">2. Low Heart Rate:</span>
                Is your resting heart rate <strong>below 72 beats per minute</strong>? This also suggests a slow
                metabolism.<br>
                <em>Warning:</em> If your heart rate is <strong>above 90 beats per minute</strong>, you must talk to a
                doctor before starting this.
            </div>

            <h4>Other Common Symptoms</h4>
            <p><em>(Check how many you have – the more you have, the more likely you need this)</em></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Always tired or waking up exhausted</li>
                <li>Brain fog, trouble concentrating, or memory loss</li>
                <li>Cold hands and feet even when it's warm</li>
                <li>Gaining weight easily or unable to lose it</li>
                <li>Dry skin or hair that is thinning/falling out</li>
                <li>Feeling low, anxious, or irritable</li>
                <li>Muscle and joint aches</li>
                <li>Frequent headaches or swelling (fluid retention)</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Quick Check:</h4>
            <p><strong>Low Morning Temp + Low Pulse + 3 or more symptoms</strong> <span
                    class="action-arrow">&rarr;</span> You may be a good candidate for T3 therapy.</p>
            <p><em>Track your temp and pulse for one week to be sure.</em></p>

        <h2>Introduction to T3 Therapy</h2>
        <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This therapy uses T3 (thyroid hormone) to help with fatigue and low body
            temperature. The goal is to "restart" your metabolism. You can dive deeper into it on this site:
            https://wilsonssyndrome.com/</p>

        <div class="guiding-questions" style="border-left-color: #8e44ad; background-color: #f4ecf7;">
            <h3>The Best Way: Slow-Release T3 (SR-T3)</h3>
            <p><strong>We strongly recommend using Slow-Release T3 (SR-T3).</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Why?</strong> It keeps your hormone levels stable all day and night. It doesn't cause sudden
                    spikes like regular T3.</li>
                <li><strong>Evening Use:</strong> You can take it in the evening to help your metabolism while you
                    sleep.</li>
                <li><strong>Easier to Use:</strong> You don't have to keep taking small doses throughout the day.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <h3>Where to Get T3</h3>
            <p>One trusted source for Slow-Release T3 is <strong><a href="https://chronic-illness.ca" target="_blank"
                        style="color: #2980b9;">chronic-illness.ca</a></strong>. They specialize in this medication and
                can ship to many places.</p>

            <h3>Why Your Blood Tests Might Lie to You</h3>
            <p><strong>The Real Problem: Tissue-Level Resistance</strong></p>
            <p>Most doctors look at your blood to see if you have enough T3. But just because T3 is in your blood
                doesn't
                mean it’s getting inside your cells where it’s needed. This is called <strong>tissue-level
                    resistance</strong>.</p>

            <p>Think of T3 as a "key" and your cells as "doors." In many sick people, the locks are jammed. The T3 keys
                are floating around in the hallway (your blood), but they can’t get into the rooms (your cells) to turn
                on the power. When a doctor draws your blood, they see plenty of keys and say, "You're fine!"—even
                though
                your body is actually starving for energy.</p>

            <p><strong>Brain Insulin Resistance</strong></p>
            <p>This problem is especially serious in the brain. When T3 can't get into your brain cells correctly, it
                leads to a type of "brain insulin resistance." This causes major brain fog, memory problems, and severe
                fatigue. Even if you eat enough food, your brain can't use that energy properly without the T3 "key" to
                unlock the process.</p>

            <p><strong>Other Signs of Resistance:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Low Body Temperature:</strong> If your cells don't have enough T3, they can't create heat.
                    This is why you feel cold even if your blood tests are "normal."</li>
                <li><strong>High Reverse T3:</strong> Sometimes your body makes a "fake key" called Reverse T3 that
                    blocks the real T3 from working.</li>
                <li><strong>Adrenal Stress:</strong> When your cells are starving for energy, your body pumps out stress
                    hormones (like cortisol) to try to keep you going. This eventually leads to total burnout.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>T3 therapy is used to "electrify" the body, sending a structured "electrical signal flood" of abundance
                and shock to finally force those jammed locks open and wake your body up. This convinces the cells that
                T3 can enter again and radically increases insulin sensitivity. Depending on the case, this may require
                a mix of T4 and high T3, or just T3—but the concept of a short, powerful energy burst remains the same.
                Do not forget to understand the critical co-factors required for T3 therapy to be safe and effective.
            </p>
            <p><strong>The Role of Genetics:</strong> In some cases, your genetics can play a big role in how your body
                handles T3. Fasting, stress, and low-carb can have different effects on different people. To learn more
                about this, visit the <a href="genetic-polymorphisms.html">Genetic Polymorphisms</a> page.</p>
