        <h1>The Scorch Protocol: An Overview</h1>
        <p>This is a guide for <strong>The Scorch Protocol</strong>, created by Yannick Wolfe (founder of the Dry
            Fasting Club). The protocol is designed to help heal chronic illnesses, especially Long Covid and autoimmune
            diseases. It uses a strong combination of dry fasting, specific diets, and metabolic therapies to help the
            body recover.</p>

        <div class="guiding-questions">
            <h3>Is this Protocol Right for You?</h3>
            <div class="question-item">
                <span class="question-label">Are you dealing with Chronic Illness (Long Covid, Fatigue,

                If <strong>YES</strong> <span class="action-arrow">&rarr;</span> This protocol focuses on deep repair,
                fixing glucose oxidation,
                and resetting your immune system.

                If <strong>YES</strong> <span class="action-arrow">&rarr;</span> This is a very intense protocol and
                might be more than you need, even though it does help with weight loss. Use it with caution.

        <h2>The Three Main Pillars</h2>
        <div class="core-pillars">
            <div class="pillar-item">
                <h3><span style="opacity: 0.3;">01.</span> Dry Fasting: Deep Cleaning</h3>
                <p>This is the most powerful way to reverse illness. Chronic sickness often hides deep in your body and
                    types up your nervous system. The Scorch Protocol uses dry fasting to trigger a "deep clean"
                    (autophagy). It forces the body to burn away old, sick cells and make room for new ones.
                    <strong>This is the engine of the entire protocol. Some people may require deeper fasting than 5 days, especially with Lyme disease.</strong>
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="pillar-item">
                <h3><span style="opacity: 0.3;">02.</span> T3 Therapy: The Metabolism Bridge</h3>
                <p>Chronic illness often puts your body into a state of "hibernation." T3 therapy acts as a bridge. By
                    raising your thyroid hormone levels, we force your body to wake up and start burning sugar for
                    energy. This speeds up healing that would normally take years.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="pillar-item">
                <h3><span style="opacity: 0.3;">03.</span> hGH Therapy: The Rebuilding Signal</h3>
                <p>While dry fasting clears out the junk, hGH (growth hormone) tells the body to rebuild. In this
                    protocol, hGH is used to help regrow the <strong>Thymus Gland</strong>, which is like the "school"
                    for your immune system. It works with T3 to keep your muscles strong and help you bounce back
                    faster.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="guiding-questions" style="background-color: #f4f6f7; border-left-color: #34495e; margin: 2rem 0;">
            <h3>The Double Advantage: Metabolism & Cleaning</h3>
            <p>Healing chronic illness requires two things: <strong>Fixing Metabolism</strong> and <strong>Clearing Out
                    Junk</strong> (like viral fragments).</p>
            <div class="question-item">
                <span class="question-label">The Cleaning Limit:</span>
                While dry fasting is the best tool for cleaning your body, it only works as well as your metabolism
                allow. If your metabolism is "shut down," your body doesn't have the energy to make the fast fully
                productive.
            </div>
            <div class="question-item">
                <span class="question-label">The Scorch Advantage:</span>
                By using <strong>T3 and hGH therapies</strong>, we put your body into an "artificially healthy" state.
                This gives your body a surge of energy that makes dry fasting <strong>10 times more effective</strong>.
                It allows the body to reach hidden pockets of disease that it would normally miss.

            <h2>Extra Helping Tools</h2>
            <p>Depending on your blood work and symptoms, we may use other tools:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fixing Insulin Resistance:</strong> Using supplements to help your body use sugar correctly.
                    This gives your brain and nerves the energy they need to stay calm and repair.</li>
                <li><strong>Immune Boosters (Peptides):</strong> Tools like <strong>Thymalin</strong> help the body
                    fight off hidden germs or viruses.</li>
                <li><strong>Organ Support:</strong> Supplements to help your Liver and Kidneys. This keeps your body's
                    "filter" clean and avoids problems during fasting.</li>
                <li><strong>Fighting Germs and Viruses:</strong> Using medications like <strong>Fluconazole</strong> for
                    fungus or <strong>Ivermectin</strong> to help support the liver and fight parasites.</li>
                <li><strong>Nicotine:</strong> Used in specific ways to help your <strong>thyroid (T3) work
                        better</strong> and protect your brain.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What Does This Protocol Cure?</h2>

            <div class="guiding-questions" style="background-color: #e8f8f5; border-left-color: #2ecc71;">
                <h3>Targeted Conditions</h3>
                <p>This protocol is very effective at reaching hidden germs and viruses, including:</p>

                <h3>The Result: A Brand New Immune System</h3>
                <p>The goal is not just "killing" germ, but <strong>replacing</strong> your immune system with a new
                    one.</p>
                <div class="question-item">
                    <span class="question-label">Why it works:</span>
                    Dry fasting triggers deep cleaning and releases "starter cells" (stem cells). Then we use T3 to help
                    rebuild your metabolism. For very sick patients, hGH therapy is used to help rebuild tissues that
                    have broken down over time.
                </div>
                <p><strong>The Final Goal:</strong> Your immune system becomes so strong that it keeps hidden viruses
                    (like Herpes) quiet forever. Your new immune system works like a security team that stops any
                    flare-up immediately, effectively curing the sickness.</p>
            </div>

            <section id="why-it-takes-long"
                style="margin-top: 3rem; background-color: #fffaf0; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px; border-left: 5px solid #f39c12;">
                <h2>Why Does This Protocol Take So Long?</h2>
                <p>One of the most common questions is why the Scorch Protocol takes so much time. It is important to
                    know that the body has a set schedule for healing that we cannot rush. <strong>The sooner you start,
                        the sooner your recovery clock begins to tick.</strong></p>

                <div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; gap: 1.5rem; margin-top: 1rem;">
                    <div>
                        <h4>1. Repairing Your Tissues</h4>
                        <p>Even if your blood levels look normal, your cells might still be "starved" for energy. It
                            takes time to clear out hormones that block your metabolism and rebuild your body's energy
                            stores. Repairing this deep damage happens slowly over months.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h4>2. Rebuilding Your "Batteries"</h4>
                        <p>Your cells' energy centers (mitochondria) need to be replaced. Old ones are cleared out and
                            new ones are grown. This is a slow process that often takes <strong>6 to 12 months</strong>
                            of consistent effort.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h4>3. Brain Healing</h4>
                        <p>Brain scans show that it takes time for the brain to recover after a virus. You might start
                            seeing some improvement in 1-2 months, but full recovery of your focus and mood often takes
                            <strong>9 to 12 months</strong>.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h4>4. Whole Body Recovery</h4>
                        <p>Things like long-term inflammation and nerve issues need to be fixed one by one. Your body
                            has to heal in a specific order to get your organs and nervous system working correctly
                            again.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p style="margin-top: 1rem; font-weight: bold; color: #d35400;">The "wait and see" approach is the enemy
                    of
                    recovery. Because these biological repairs take months to manifest, delaying the start of the Scorch
                    Protocol simply pushes your eventual recovery date further into the future.</p>
            </section>

            <div class="guidance-box"
                style="background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #6c757d; margin: 2rem 0;">
                <p style="font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                    I have been exactly where you are. I suffered through severe Long Covid and autoimmune issues
                    twice, feeling trapped with no way out. Then I discovered dry fasting and spent years
                    experimenting to unlock its full power. I gamed the system that tried to keep this knowledge
                    hidden, and now I give it back to you freely through the Dry Fasting Club.
                </p>

                <p style="font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                    That is why I share the core of my Scorch Protocol openly, with detailed guides anyone can
                    access. It combines strategic dry fasting to trigger intense
                    autophagy, burn away damaged cells and DNA, and rebuild with fresh stem cells. It also combines T3
