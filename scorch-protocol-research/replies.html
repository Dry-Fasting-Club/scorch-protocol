            <h2>Combining Ray Peat with Intermittent Fasting (IF)</h2>
            <p>
                The improvements in thermoregulation and calm alertness that you reported are interesting, indicating
                that
                your body didn't lose most its ability to use the carbs yet.

                Many long term keto dieters have a very horrible time bringing back carbs initially.
                Yes Ray Peat discouraged fasting, and I agree that Intermittent fasting is ridiculous, I wish I never
                did it for 15 years, but it was my way of self-medicating without understanding bioenergetics.
                But let's not lump short term dry fasts into that. They have miraculous therapeutic benefits. I
                personally believe that Ray messed up on fasting benefits and he could have helped his 10 year lung
                condition with it.

                While i do believe the idea that the body utilizes energy to heal, and high energy is high healing, this
                doesn't apply to everything because then Ray wouldn't have had those problems.
                And side note, dry fasting is extremely effective at dealing with lung problems. The anti-edema effects
                are unique and the lungs have a hard time removing mucus and wet buildup, but the dry fast creates an
                environment that sucks it all up. Pair that with anti-inflamatory which allows you to breathe, its very
                pwoerful for lung conditions. I wish ray peat knew about it.

                Regarding the anxiety and heart rate spikes after consuming honey at night: there's an issue here when
                your body is in the transition stage. when you feed it glucose it tries to run on carbs for energy and
                slows down gluconeogenesis, then when it keeps jumping between both states it has trouble until you
                retrain your bodies glucose systems, example: liver storage total capacity. its going to take a while
                but the more days you do carbs the larger the liver storage capacity will be and its ability to better
                quickly regulate glucose using glycogen. right now you can experience night time issues when it runs out
                and the body panics trying to switch systems from glucose to ketone/gluconeogenesis
