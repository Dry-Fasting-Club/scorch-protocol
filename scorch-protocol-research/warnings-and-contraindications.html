        <h1>Warnings and Contraindications</h1>

        <section id="dangerous-dry-fasts">
            <h2>When do dry fasts become dangerous?</h2>

            <p>While dry fasting is a powerful tool for healing, there is a dangerous trend pushing for extreme
                durations. It is critical to distinguish between therapeutic hermetic stress and dangerous physiological
                damage.</p>

            <h3>Safe vs. Dangerous Durations</h3>
            <p>Based on clinical observations and safety data:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>5 Days (The Safe Limit):</strong> Often cited as the safest "longest" dry fast that can be
                    performed by most individuals without special medical guidance. At this stage, the body achieves
                    deep autophagy without crossing into dangerous dehydration territory for the average person.</li>
                <li><strong>9 Days (The "Hormetic Reset" Limit):</strong> Some advanced practitioners may benefit from a
                    9-day fast for a full hormetic reset. This pushes the body to its limit to trigger maximum
                    adaptation but requires significant experience and preparation.</li>
                <li><strong>>9 Days (Playing with Fire):</strong> Going longer than 9 days is entering a zone of extreme
                    risk. The marginal benefits rarely outweigh the exponential increase in danger to metabolic and
                    neurological health.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Danger of "Trevor's Recommendations"</h3>
            <p>One of the most concerning trends is the advice seen on channels like <strong>"Fasting with
                    Trevor"</strong>, which frequently pushes for <strong>11-day minimums</strong> and <strong>21-day
                    dry fasts</strong> as a "fix-all." This advice contradicts established physiological safety
                thresholds.</p>

            <h3>Metabolic Devastation</h3>
            <p>Pushing the body to 11-21 days without water forces it into a state of extreme catabolism.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Severe Metabolic Downregulation:</strong> The body enters a deep starvation mode to preserve
                    survival. Research from the <strong>Minnesota Starvation Experiment</strong> <a
                        href="https://psychiatry.duke.edu/news/starvation-experiment" target="_blank">[The Biology of
                        Human Starvation, Keys et al.]</a>
                    demonstrated that
                    prolonged semi-starvation can lead to a <strong>drop in Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) by up to
                        40%</strong>. Bringing the metabolism back from this depth is incredibly difficult and can take
                    months or years.</li>
                <li><strong>Muscle Catabolism:</strong> While the body has protein-sparing mechanisms, extended
                    starvation eventually forces the body to cannibalize essential tissue, including heart muscle, for
                    gluconeogenesis once fat oxidation becomes insufficient or metabolic stress is too high.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Neurological Risks and Brain Function</h3>
            <p>The most insidious potential damage is to the brain, driven by severe dehydration and starvation
                physiology.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cognitive Decline:</strong> Research indicates that even mild dehydration (>2% body mass
                    loss) significantly impairs cognitive performance and executive function <a
                        href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4207053/" target="_blank">[Cognitive
                        Performance and Dehydration, Adan et al.]</a>. At the
                    extreme levels of
                    an 11+ day dry fast, this cognitive impairment can become profound.</li>
                <li><strong>Blood Viscosity & Stroke Risk:</strong> Dehydration leads to hemoconcentration (thickening
                    of the blood). High blood viscosity is a known risk factor for reduced cerebral blood flow and an
                    increased risk of ischemic stroke <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5424590/"
                        target="_blank">[Elevated Blood Viscosity and Cerebral Small Vessel Disease, Song et al.]</a>.
                    If circulation slows enough, capillaries in the brain may close
                    off, potentially leading to <strong>permanent neuron death</strong> due to hypoxia.</li>
                <li><strong>"Brain Shrinkage":</strong> Studies have shown that acute dehydration can cause a reduction
                    in brain tissue volume, similar to the atrophy seen in aging. While often reversible with
                    rehydration, the chronic stress of repeated extreme fasts raises concerns about permanent damage and
                    IQ loss.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="warning-box"
                style="background-color: #fee; border-left: 5px solid #c00; padding: 1rem; color: #c00;">
                <strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Extended dry fasts of 11-21 days are <strong>unnecessary</strong> and
                potentially <strong>dangerous</strong>. Stick to the safer 5-9 day window to achieve healing without
                risking permanent metabolic or neurological damage.
