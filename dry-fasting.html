        <h1>Phase 2: The Dry Fast (The Scorch)</h1>

        <div

            <h3 style="color: #721c24; margin-top: 0;">Read This First (Safety Warning)</h3>
            <p style="color: #721c24; margin-bottom: 0;">Dry fasting (no food or water) is an advanced tool with
                serious risks. It can lead to severe dehydration, mineral imbalances, and organ strain. This is not for
                everyone. <strong>Talk to a doctor before trying this</strong>, especially if you have heart or kidney
                problems, are underweight, pregnant, or on medications. For fasts longer than 2 days, you must have
                medical help or regular check-ins. This guide is for teaching purposes only.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Phase 1: Getting Ready</h2>
        <p>Preparing correctly avoids a "detox crash" and makes the fast easier.</p>

            <h3>Pre-Fast Checklist</h3>
            <div class="question-item">
                <span class="question-label">Who Should NOT Fast:</span>
                Do <strong>NOT</strong> start if you: Are pregnant, have Kidney or Heart disease, are underweight (BMI
                under 18), have a sudden infection, or are on water pills (diuretics).
            </div>
            <div class="question-item">
                <span class="question-label">Support Team:</span>
                Have you set up a way to check in daily with someone you trust? (Very important for fasts over 3 days).
            </div>
        </div>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Choosing Your Diet:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>If you are sick or in high pain:</em> You <strong>should</strong> eat a Ketogenic (high
                        fat, low carb) diet for <strong>1 to 2 months</strong> before you start. If your body has
                        struggled with fasting before, you must do this first.</li>
                    <li><em>Standard Prep:</em> For everyone else, you don't need major dietary changes, but eating
                        low-carb for 3 days before the fast can help reduce hunger.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Get Your Mind Right:</strong> Write down why you are doing this and focus your mind. A
                strong mindset helps you through the tough emotional parts.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Phase 2: Starting Slowly</h2>
        <p><strong>Do NOT jump straight to 5 days.</strong> You must build up your body's strength.</p>

                <td style="width: 30%;"><strong>1. Beginner</strong><br>"The First Step"</td>
                <td>Start with a <strong>36-hour</strong> dry fast. Then recover fully.</td>

            <tr>

                <td>After a successful 36-hour fast (and a week-long break), try <strong>72 hours</strong>.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>3. Advanced</strong><br>"Deep Repair"</td>
                <td>Only after finishing 72 hours successfully, move to <strong>5 days</strong>.</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p><em>Between Fasts: Wait 5 to 10 days while eating normally to recover.</em></p>

        <h2>Phase 3: The Dry Fast (The Scorch)</h2>
        <p><strong>How it works:</strong> Your body starts getting water by burning old, damaged cells and fat. This
            speeds up deep cleaning (autophagy) and releases new building blocks (stem cells).</p>

        <h3>The Stages of a 5-Day Fast</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Burning Sugar (0-24h):</strong> Your body uses up its sugar stores. You will feel hungry, but
                thirst is usually okay.</li>
            <li><strong>The Acidosis Stage (24-72h):</strong> Your body switches to burning fat. This creates a mild
                "acid" state that triggers a massive "deep clean" (The Scorch). You might feel heat inside your body.
            </li>
            <li><strong>The Peak Stage (Day 4-5):</strong> This is the deepest repair phase. You might feel a "healing
                fever." You will pee less, and your energy might dip before you feel clear-headed.</li>
            <li><strong>Regeneration (Day 5+):</strong> New cells are released, and you might feel a surge of energy as
                your body adapts.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What to do During the Fast</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Environment:</strong> Stay in a cool room with fresh air. Rest as much as possible—only do very
                light walking.</li>
            <li><strong>Daily Habits:</strong> Try gentle belly massage, dry skin brushing, and light stretching.</li>
            <li><strong>Tracking:</strong> Watch your weight (you will lose 1-2 lbs per day), heart rate, and the
                coating on your tongue.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="guiding-questions" style="background-color: #fadbd8; border-left-color: #e74c3c;">
            <h3>When to Stop Immediately (Red Flags)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Heart rate stays over 120 bpm while resting</li>
                <li>Feeling very dizzy or fainting</li>
                <li>Strong pain in your kidneys</li>
                <li>Feeling confused or having blurry vision</li>
                <li>Swelling in your legs or hands</li>
                <li>Not peeing for more than 12 hours</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Phase 4: Breaking the Fast</h2>
        <p><strong>Very Important:</strong> Eating too much too fast can be dangerous. Your "refeed" should last 2 to 3
            times longer than the fast itself.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The First Hour:</strong> <strong>Drink Coconut Water only.</strong> Do not drink plain water
                yet. Take tiny sips (half a cup over a whole hour). This tells your new cells to start growing
                correctly.</li>
            <li><strong>Hours 2-4:</strong> Keep drinking coconut water very slowly (about one cup every hour).</li>
            <li><strong>Day 1 After the Fast:</strong> Stick to coconut water. In the late afternoon, you can have a
                small bowl of soft, mushy rice if you feel stable.</li>
            <li><strong>Day 2 to 7:</strong> Follow the rice and fruit schedule. (See the <a
                    href="refeeding.html">Refeeding Page</a> for the full plan).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What to Expect at Each Stage</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>36 Hours:</strong> A quick energy reset and light detox.</li>
            <li><strong>72 Hours:</strong> Deep cleaning starts and inflammation goes down.</li>
            <li><strong>5 Days:</strong> Maximum repair, new stem cells are released, and you feel much better.</li>
        </ul>
