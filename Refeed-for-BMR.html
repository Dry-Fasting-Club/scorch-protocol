        <h1>9-Month Metabolism Repair Plan</h1>
        <p>This plan uses data from the <strong>Minnesota Starvation Experiment (1944–1945)</strong> to help you fix a
            slowed-down metabolism. It explains how your body shuts down certain parts to save energy and how to
            "rebuild" your health after a long illness or fasting.</p>

        <div class="guiding-questions" style="background-color: #fadbd8; border-left-color: #e74c3c;">
            <h3>What You Need to Know</h3>
            <div class="question-item">
                <span class="question-label">Recovery Takes Time:</span>
                Healing your body is like <strong>rebuilding a house</strong>. It needs 8 to 12 months of eating plenty
                of food to fix the damage. Your body has to move from "survival mode" back to "health mode."
            </div>
            <div class="question-item">
                <span class="question-label">Food is the Key:</span>
                The most important finding: <strong>Calories are the only way to fix a slow metabolism.</strong>
                Vitamins and protein are wasted if you aren't eating enough total energy (calories).
            </div>
            <div class="question-item">
                <span class="question-label">The 9-Month Goal:</span>
                After about 9 months, your body finally feels "safe." The survival alarm in your brain turns off, and
                your metabolism (BMR) goes back to normal.
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>The "Survival List": What Shuts Down First</h2>
        <p>When you are sick or starving, your body "turns off the lights" in certain areas to save your brain and
            heart. Healing means "re-lighting" these systems in this order:</p>

        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th style="width: 30%;">Part of the Body</th>
                    <th style="width: 70%;">What Shuts Down</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Skin and Hair</strong></td>
                    <td>Your body stops making oil and new skin cells. This leads to a dry scalp, brittle skin, and
                        thinning hair.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Hormones</strong></td>
                    <td>Sex hormones drop. This causes a low sex drive and irregular periods in women.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Body Heat</strong></td>
                    <td>Your body temperature drops, making you feel cold all the time.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Immune System</strong></td>
                    <td>Your body makes fewer white blood cells, making it easier for you to get sick.</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <h2>The "Energy First" Rule</h2>
        <p>The Minnesota Experiment showed that you cannot heal your body on 2,000 to 2,500 calories. For a starving or
            sick body, that amount only keeps you where you are. To actually fix your metabolism, you must eat 3,500 to
            4,000+ calories a day.</p>

        <div class="guiding-questions" style="background-color: #eafaf1; border-left-color: #27ae60;">
            <h3>Key Metabolic Rules</h3>
            <div class="question-item">
                <span class="question-label">The Supplement Problem:</span>
                Vitamins and extra protein are wasted if you aren't eating enough total calories. If you eat too little,
                your body just burns these expensive nutrients like cheap fuel.
            </div>
            <div class="question-item">
                <span class="question-label">The 4,000 Calorie Mark:</span>
                Healing only really starts when you reach <strong>3,500 to 4,000+ calories</strong>. Eating less than
                this stalls your recovery.
            </div>
            <div class="question-item">
                <span class="question-label">Researcher's Note:</span>
                <em>"Unless you eat plenty of calories, extra protein and vitamins won't help much."</em> Your body
                needs raw energy for a long time to fix its metabolism.
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>How to Start Eating Again (The Safe Start)</h2>
        <p>While 4,000 calories is the goal, you cannot start there on day one. You must slowly introduce your body to
            all that food to stay safe.</p>

        <div class="guiding-questions" style="background-color: #fff3cd; border-left-color: #ffc107;">
            <h3>Safety Rules</h3>
            <div class="question-item">
                <span class="question-label">Heart Health:</span>
                Do <strong>NOT</strong> eat 5,000 calories in the first week. Slowly increase your food intake to avoid
                "Refeeding Syndrome." This is a dangerous condition where sudden spikes in insulin can cause your heart
                to fail.
            </div>
            <div class="question-item">
                <span class="question-label">Insulin Spikes:</span>
                Eating a lot of food after a fast causes a huge rush of insulin. If it happens too fast, it can pull
                vital minerals out of your blood and into your cells, which can be deadly.
            </div>
            <div class="question-item">
                <span class="question-label">No Caffeine:</span>
                Avoid caffeine. It makes it harder for your cells to handle insulin and forces your already tired body
                to work too hard, which slows down your recovery.
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>The Timeline: The "Year-Long Cavity"</h2>
        <p>Recovery is not a switch; it is a 9-month biological season. The body follows a predictable sequence of
            restoration, prioritizing survival mechanisms before luxury functions.</p>

        <h3>Phase I: The Survival Phase (Months 1–3)</h3>
        <p>This phase is cut down to 1 month if you use the Scorch Protocol correctly.</p>
        <div class="guiding-questions" style="background-color: #e8f4f8; border-left-color: #3498db;">
            <h4>Goal: Stabilize the heart and stay safe.</h4>
            <div class="question-item">
                <span class="question-label">How Your Body Feels:</span>
                Your body is in "survival mode" and your metabolism is slowed down by about <strong>40%</strong>. You
                will likely feel "hungry but exhausted."
            </div>
            <div class="question-item">
                <span class="question-label">The 3,000 Calorie Rule:</span>
                You must eat more than <strong>3,000 to 3,500 calories</strong> to tell your brain the famine is over.
                Anything less just maintains a starvation state.
            </div>
            <div class="question-item">
                <span class="question-label">Feeling Worse First:</span>
                You might actually feel worse at first. As your nervous system "wakes up," you might feel more annoyed
                and think about food more. This is a sign that your body is turning back on.
            </div>
        </div>

        <h3>Phase II: The "Fat Buffer" Phase (Months 3–6)</h3>
        <p>The Scorch Protocol uses T3, hGH, and specific foods to help you move through this phase faster and avoid too
            much fat gain.</p>
        <div class="guiding-questions" style="background-color: #fef5e7; border-left-color: #f39c12;">
            <h4>Goal: Build an "emergency fund" of energy.</h4>
            <div class="question-item">
                <span class="question-label">Fat Before Muscle:</span>
                The body is programmed to build fat first. In the study, men had to reach <strong>140% of their original
                    fat</strong> before their muscles started growing back.
            </div>
            <div class="question-item">
                <span class="question-label">Body Defense:</span>
                This fat gain is a protection. Your body won't spend energy on building muscle until it feels safe with
                enough fat to survive another famine.
            </div>
            <div class="question-item">
                <span class="question-label">Warming Up:</span>
                You will notice you stop feeling cold all the time as your body starts spending energy on keeping you
                warm.
            </div>
            <div class="question-item">
                <span class="question-label">Getting Through It:</span>
                This is the hardest part mentally. Gaining fat is a sign the plan is working; your body is prioritizing
                survival over looks.
            </div>
        </div>

        <h3>Phase III: Rebuilding Muscle (Months 6–9+)</h3>
        <div class="guiding-questions" style="background-color: #d4edda; border-left-color: #28a745;">
            <h4>Goal: Build muscle and return to normal.</h4>
            <div class="question-item">
                <span class="question-label">Muscle Growth:</span>
                Your muscles and strength only start growing back <strong>after</strong> your body feels safe with its
                fat buffer. By month 7, your body finally allows the energy to be spent on deep cellular repair.
            </div>
            <div class="question-item">
                <span class="question-label">Metabolism Normalizes:</span>
                Your metabolism finally returns to its original level. The "braking system" that was slowing you down
                finally turns off.
            </div>
            <div class="question-item">
                <span class="question-label">Ending the Famine:</span>
                The constant, intense hunger finally goes away. This means the "famine alarm" in your brain has finally
                been turned off.
            </div>
            <div class="question-item">
                <span class="question-label">Be Patient:</span>
                It can take some people up to two years to get back to their full strength. <strong>Patience is the most
                    important thing for your metabolism.</strong>
            </div>

                <li><strong>Calories come first:</strong> Without enough energy, other nutrients are wasted.</li>
                <li><strong>Recovery takes time:</strong> It takes at least 9 months (and up to 2 years) to fully heal.

                <li><strong>Trust the plan:</strong> Fat gain and initial discomfort mean the plan is working.</li>
